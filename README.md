# Simulation Code for Nonlinear Dynamic Panel Models

These codes provide the Python and Julia implementations for the simulation results of the paper "Identification of Nonlinear Dynamic Panels under Partial Stationarity," by Wayne Gao and Rui Wang. 

The latest version of the working paper can be found in this repository. Descriptions of the inference method and the simulation details are available in the paper.
